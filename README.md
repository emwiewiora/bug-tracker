# bug-tracker
This is intended to be a real world web application to use as the center piece of my profolio. 

As a beginner webdev I have built and will continue to build many project in order to learn to code. Most of the projects are required for different learning programs.  While they are all good for what they are, none of them, so far, solve real world problems.  By chance, a video popped in my YouTube feed stating the "One project you need to get hired".  While I didn't agree with everything that it stated, the overall point resinated with me.  Build a bug tracker.  This is an application that is easily recognisable to any developer. It utlizes some form of every basic feature of a modern application like; user logins, responsive design, and a database. See the SRS document for more information.

Note: This is not ment to be a full blown, sellable product.  It just needs to work.
